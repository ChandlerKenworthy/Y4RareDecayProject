# Year 4 LHCb Rare Decay Project
This project will contian all the code used in my year 4 master's project which uses data from LHCb to study hints of lepton universality violation. This search looks primarily for the decay of the $\lambda_B$ meson into a $\lambda(1520)$ and two muons with the $\lambda(1520)$ decaying to a proton and a kaon.

- Data files generated in test.ipynb utilising create_data.py, preselection.txt and request.txt. 
- Analysis done in the appropriate folders just have a look around. Sorry for the awful documentation it was all done on-the-fly.
