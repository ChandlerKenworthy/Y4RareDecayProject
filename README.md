# Year 4 LHCb Rare Decay Project
This project will contian all the code used in my year 4 master's project which uses data from LHCb to study hints of lepton universality violation. This search looks primarily for the decay of the $\lambda_B$ meson into a $\lambda(1520)$ and two muons with the $\lambda(1520)$ decaying to a proton and a kaon.
