    "# Equal Event Ratio Network\n",
    "This notebook will use an equal event ratio along with the revised pre-selection criteria and suggested features from Dan and Paul. Hopefully this will vastly reduce any overfitting and massively improve generality of our model. We expect it to do worse in training because this is now a much more complex task. To speed things up we called in all the data and generated new features in the notebook reduced_feature_network and saved it as a CSV."

We will use a similar architecture to what was working well with the many features from before but simplify it a little. We will monitor the accuracy, loss, AUC and ROC curves for the network as it trains. Then we can start analysing features further and see how much each impacts event selection."
